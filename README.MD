# Java Snaps!

At the end of 2022, I found myself a little bit slow in starting everyday work. 
I had a ritual of checking messages, emails, and company updates before actually digging into a code. 
In 2023, I challenge myself to start the work with a short and quick coding task that will help me warm up before actual work! 
Care to join me?

Rules are simple. 
For the whole of January, I will create a new coding challenge. 
Daily. Tasks will intend to take a few minutes to solve, maybe it will require some research from you. 
Every task will focus on Java, popular libraries and frameworks. So, let's start!
