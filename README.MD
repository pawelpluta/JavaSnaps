# Java Snaps!

Starting in 2023, I made a New Year's resolution that I will write a coding task every day for the whole of January. 
I planned to focus only on Java API, but it was just boring. 
Instead of that, this repo will contain tasks around JVM and focus on useful frameworks, libraries and approaches. 
Feel free to fork it and solve the challenges.

The main branch contains only tasks - they might not compile, but most of them will contain tests to check your solution. 
You might want to check also the sample-solution branch.
