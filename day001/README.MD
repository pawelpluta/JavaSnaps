# Day 1 - bug hunting

There was an incident at one of the Rembrandt masterpiece auction. After the auction was closed and the highest bid was selected, somehow the Offerer information didn't match. It looked like someone placed a higher bid after the auction was closed!

A lot of people were mad, as it appears that the system allows you to overtake the highest bid just by a minimal amount after the auction was finished. The Auction House decided to retake the bidding tomorrow. You need to find the bug, write an automated test that covers it and fix it.
