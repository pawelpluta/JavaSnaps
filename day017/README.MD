# Day 17 - micronaut REST API

Micronaut is an alternative to Spring Framework.
In usage, they are very similar with concept, although they differ in mechanics.

Your task is to create an endpoint, inject mocked Person repository and return the value.
API should produce JSON and be exposed under `/persons/{pesel}` address.
