# Day 15 - kafka listener

Today you need to implement kafka listener and save received information into database.
You will need to configure it first, then create a listener class and method with implementation.
Check the test application properties to see the proposed naming for the values that will configure the consumer.
Remember that the event will be sent as JSON.

Test will check, if event sent to the topic is later stored in the database.
