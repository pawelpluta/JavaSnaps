# Day 12 - Kotlin basics

Multiple languages are using JVM. An alternative is Kotlin. 
Although new Java version catch up the features that Kotlin added, it is still nice to use it.

This task is going to introduce basics of Kotlin. 
Implement few methods in that language - one for string building, one for optional values handling, and one for data filtration.
Tests will check if your code is valid.
